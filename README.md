# navbar

A minimal Quickshell top bar for omarchy. Kanagawa Dragon layout, kanji workspace markers, omarchy-theme-aware colors.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bjarneo/quickshell-navbar ~/.config/quickshell/navbar

# disable omarchy's waybar (see below)
omarchy toggle waybar

# autostart on every Hyprland session
install -m 755 ~/.config/quickshell/navbar/contrib/post-boot.d/quickshell-navbar \
  ~/.config/omarchy/hooks/post-boot.d/quickshell-navbar

# launch once now
qs -n -d -c navbar
```

Reload the Hyprland session (or run `omarchy-hook post-boot`) and the bar will appear.

## Requirements

| Package | Why |
| --- | --- |
| quickshell | The runtime that loads `shell.qml`. |
| hyprland | Provides `hyprctl` for workspace state and active workspace. |
| pamixer | Audio mute query. |
| bluetoothctl | Bluetooth power and connection state. |
| nmcli | Wifi signal strength when no ethernet is up. |
| omarchy | For the theme file at `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml`. |

## Toggle waybar

omarchy ships a one-shot toggle that flips waybar between enabled and disabled:

```sh
omarchy toggle waybar
```

It's also bound to `SUPER + SHIFT + SPACE` out of the box. Under the hood it manages the `~/.local/state/omarchy/toggles/waybar-off` flag, which omarchy's autostart checks at session start.

The toggle only affects whether waybar launches on the *next* Hyprland session. To swap bars live without re-login:

```sh
pkill waybar                          # stop the current waybar
waybar &>/dev/null & disown           # or, to restart it
```

## Theme reactivity

The bar reads `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml` and remaps these keys:

| toml key | role | maps to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| background | bar surface | `paper` |
| foreground | primary text | `ink` |
| color7 | secondary text | `inkDeep` |
| color8 | muted decoration | `sumi` |
| accent | info accent | `indigo` |
| color1 | active workspace, alerts | `seal` |

`omarchy theme set <name>` rebuilds the theme dir atomically (`rm -rf` + `mv`). That invalidates the inotify watch on `colors.toml`, so the bar also watches `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme.name` (rewritten in place via `echo > file`, stable inode) as a swap beacon and force-reloads the palette when it fires.

## Layout

```
left   | omarchy icon | sep | ws1 ws2 ws3 ws4 ws5 ws6 ws7 ws8 ws9 ws10 |
center | HH:MM | DD MON |
right  | cpu | net | bt | audio | battery |
```

- Click the omarchy glyph to open `omarchy-menu`. Right-click for `xdg-terminal-exec`.
- Click a kanji to `hyprctl dispatch workspace N`.
- Click the audio glyph to open `omarchy-launch-audio`. Right-click toggles mute.
- Click battery to open the power menu.

## Customization

Everything lives in `shell.qml`. Common tweaks:

| Want to change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Bar height | `barHeight` property near the top. |
| Workspace count | `Repeater { model: 10 ... }`. |
| Animation speed | `Behavior on ... { duration: ... }` blocks in the `Workspace` component. |
| Font | `mono` and `serif` properties. |
| Telemetry interval | The `Timer { interval: ... }` blocks. |

Quickshell hot-reloads on save, so edits show up live.

## Autostart hook

`contrib/post-boot.d/quickshell-navbar` is a drop-in for omarchy's hook system. It runs ~2s after Hyprland starts.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
qs -n -d -c navbar
```

`-d` daemonizes (so the hook returns immediately). `-n` makes it idempotent (no double-launch if `omarchy-hook post-boot` runs again).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `Could not open config file at "navbar"` | Use `-c navbar`, not `-p navbar`. `-c` resolves to `~/.config/quickshell/navbar/shell.qml`. |
| Theme colors don't update on `omarchy theme set` | Check `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme.name` exists and is being rewritten. The bar uses it as the reload trigger. |
| Workspace switch feels laggy | Bump `wsProbe`'s `Timer { interval: ... }` from 500ms down to 150ms, or wire it to Hyprland's IPC socket. |
| Qt version mismatch warning | `quickshell` was built against an older Qt minor. Rebuild the package against your current Qt. |
